This is a demonstration of data structure implementations. I was tasked with sorting patients based on their priority, then treatment. 

FinalProject.cpp is my main driver function using an interactive terminal. To change the data size you must change the define variable DATA_SIZE.

A linked list, priority queue from the STL, and a min-heap are used to store data.

To run the program execute build.sh.
